Standing around the whiteboard, each member in our band of misfits write up three priorities for their day: Two outcomes or tasks they need to achieve, and one wellness challenge.</p><p>Everyone chooses a different wellness challenge each day – it could be colouring one day, doing 5 press-ups the next day, or eating lunch with someone you don’t normally talk to the next.</p><p>Then, the next morning we report back on our success, before erasing yesterday’s challenges and starting fresh.</p><p>Building wellness into an every-day ritual helps build a culture of mutual respect, encouragement, awareness and (most importantly) fun.</p><p><a href="#" class="button">Read the blog</a><a href="#" class="button">Visit Weirdly</a></p></div></div></body><script src="js/main.js"></script></html>
