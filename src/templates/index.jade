                h1 The #WellnessChallenge
                p Every morning in the Weirdly office starts with a team standup. Standing around the whiteboard, each member in our band of misfits write up three priorities for their day: Two outcomes or tasks they need to achieve, and one wellness challenge.
                p Everyone chooses a different wellness challenge each day – it could be colouring one day, doing 5 press-ups the next day, or eating lunch with someone you don’t normally talk to the next.
                p Then, the next morning we report back on our success, before erasing yesterday’s challenges and starting fresh.
                p Building wellness into an every-day ritual helps build a culture of mutual respect, encouragement, awareness and (most importantly) fun.
